          I studied Economics; however, during my last semester at university, I
          discovered the world of software development with
          <span class="text-primary-500">Python</span>. This inspired me to
          learn more about programming, specifically in the field of Economics.
          Later, I decided to create a website for my brother's business, which
          is how I learned
          <span class="text-primary-500">Web Development</span> with
          <span class="text-primary-500">Django</span>.
